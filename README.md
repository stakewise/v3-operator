**You can find the vault address either in the URL bar or in the "Contract address" field by scrolling to the "Details"
at
the bottom of the page. The vault address is used in the following sections.**

## Installation

Operator Service can be run via a binary, docker image, deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using the
Operator Helm Chart, or built from source. Decide on your preferred method and follow the respective instructions below.

### Binary

Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-operator/releases) to find the latest version of Operator
Service. Identify the binary file specific to your
node hardware, download and decompress it.

You will execute Operator Service commands from within the `v3-operator` folder using the below format (note that the
use of flags is optional):

```bash
./operator COMMAND --flagA=123 --flagB=xyz
```

### Install script (Linux and macOS)

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakewise/v3-operator/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
```

The binary will be installed inside the ~/bin directory. Add the binary to your path:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
```

If you want to install a specific version to a custom location, run:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakewise/v3-operator/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b <custom_location> vX.X.X
```

You will execute Operator Service commands using the below format (note that the use of flags is optional):

```bash
operator COMMAND --flagA=123 --flagB=xyz
```

### Docker Image

```bash
docker pull europe-west4-docker.pkg.dev/stakewiselabs/public/v3-operator:v4.1.0
```

You can also build the docker image from source by cloning this repo and executing the following command from within
the `v3-operator` folder:

```bash
docker build --pull -t europe-west4-docker.pkg.dev/stakewiselabs/public/v3-operator:v4.1.0 .
```

You will execute Operator Service commands using the format below (note the use of flags are optional):

```bash
docker run --rm -ti \
-u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
-v ~/.stakewise/:/data \
europe-west4-docker.pkg.dev/stakewiselabs/public/v3-operator:v4.1.0 \
src/main.py COMMAND \
--flagA=123 \
--flagB=xyz
```

### Source Files

Build requirements:

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

Clone this repo and install dependencies by executing the following command from within the `v3-operator` folder:

```bash
poetry install --only main
```

You will execute Operator Service commands from within the `v3-operator` folder using the below format (note that the
use of flags is optional):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. poetry run python src/main.py COMMAND --flagA=123 --flagB=xyz
```
